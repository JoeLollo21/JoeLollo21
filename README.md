### hello! ðŸ‘‹
I am passionate about designing inclusive, interactive learning experiences with different technologies. I approach library services from a holistic viewpoint, using technology to create new pathways for student engagement. My work primarily consists of teaching college students how to engage with the research environment and create digital projects.
