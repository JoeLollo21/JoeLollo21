I am an academic librarian passionate about designing inclusive, interactive learning experiences with different technologies. I approach library services from a holistic viewpoint, developing programs and spaces for students' learning, development, and success, and am committed to using technology to develop new pathways for student engagement. My work primarily consists of teaching college students how to do research, use complex research databases, and access different softwares and technologies.
