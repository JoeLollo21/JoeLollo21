### Hi there, I'm Joe ðŸ‘‹
I am currently a graduate studet in the [Master of Library and Information Science](https://ischool.uw.edu/programs/mlis) program at the University of Washington interested in instructional design, digital and data literacy, and digital humanities scholarship and education. I am interested in how data science and curation methods can create new research discoveries, as well as how these methods can be clearly communicated and taught for others to apply to their own research and problem solving.
