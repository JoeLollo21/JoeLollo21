### Hi there, I'm Joe ðŸ‘‹
I am currently a graduate studet in the [Master of Library and Information Science](https://ischool.uw.edu/programs/mlis) program at the University of Washington interested in instructional design, digital and data literacy, and digital humanities scholarship and education. 
<br><br>
I am particularly interested in how data literacy can be applied to multiple fields to create new research discoveries, and how it can be communicated and taught for others in an accessible way.
<br><br>
