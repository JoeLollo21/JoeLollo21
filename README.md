### Hi there, I'm Joe ðŸ‘‹
I am currently a graduate studet in the [Master of Library and Information Science](https://ischool.uw.edu/programs/mlis) program at the University of Washington interested in instructional design, digital and data literacy, and digital humanities scholarship and education. 
<br><br>
I am interested in how data science and curation methods can be applied to multiple fields to create new research discoveries, as well as how they can be communicated and taught for others in an accessible way.
